## I. Introduction
### 1. RFM analysis

**What is RFM analysis**

- RFM stands for recency, frequency, and monetary value, three key indicators used to analyze customer behavior and identify groups of customers that share similar characteristics.
- Understanding RFM analysis can help you get a pulse on your current customer engagement levels (recency), identify loyal and regular customers (frequency), and highlight high-value customers (monetary value). 

**Why RFM**

- With RFM, you can segment customers based on their purchasing patterns to help you predict future behavior, target your marketing efforts effectively, find your best customers, and increase customer retention. Customer loyalty is a critical factor that can make or break your business.
  - **Recency** provides insights into current customer engagement levels by measuring how much time has passed since their last purchase.
  - **Frequency** lets you see which customers are loyal and engage with your brand or company regularly by measuring how often customers interact with you within a specific period of time.
  - **Monetary value** helps to highlight which customers are most valuable and generate the most revenue for your business. This number represents the total amount of money a specific person has spent on your company as a customer.
- Understanding recency, frequency, and monetary value will help you make informed decisions about how to optimize your marketing strategies, increase retention, identify your best customers, and ultimately drive business success.
